## Switch

The on / off [switch](https://material.google.com/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-switch) switches the status of a single setting option. The options in the switch controller, as well as the status of the switch, should be displayed with the accompanying inline label. The switch selector has the same visual properties as the radio button.
