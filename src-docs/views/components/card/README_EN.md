## Card

The [card](https://material.google.com/components/cards.html) component is a piece of paper that contains a specific set of data containing a variety of related information, such as photos, text, and links for a single topic. Cards are usually the gateway to more detailed and complex information. The card has a fixed width and a variable height. The maximum height is limited by the content of the view, but if needed, it maybe be temporarily extended (*e.g.* to display comments). The card component can not be flipped to show more content.
