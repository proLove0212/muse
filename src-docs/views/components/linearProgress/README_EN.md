## Linear Progress

The [linear progress](https://material.google.com/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators) indicator should always be displayed from 0% to 100%, never from high to low. If there is a number of ongoing operations in a queue, use a progress indicator to indicate the time required for the whole. This way, when the indicator reaches 100%, it will not return to 0% and then start again.
