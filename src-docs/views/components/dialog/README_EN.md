## Dialog

The [dialog](https://material.google.com/components/dialogs.html) component is used to reminder user to do some action, or to add some extra information when you are finishing some tasks. Dialogs can be used as a simple response mode with Ok/Cancel. It can be use as a complicated mode with customized layouts, *e.g.* a text setting or input text.
