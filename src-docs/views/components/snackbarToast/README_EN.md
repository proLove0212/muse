## Snackbar & Toast

[Snackbar & Toast](https://material.google.com/components/snackbars-toasts.html) are a feedback mechanism which is lightweight, always displaying a small pop up box, and appear in the bottom of mobile screen or desktop. They have the biggest z-index.

They will disappear automatically when they time out or a user click on other screen positions. When they are appearing, it should not influence the user's operation, and also not hide inputs. One page should have only one snack bar.

The toast component is similar to the Snackbar one, but the toast component dones not include any action.
