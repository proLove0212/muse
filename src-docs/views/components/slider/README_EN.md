## Slider

The [slider](https://material.google.com/components/sliders.html) controls allow us to select an appropriate value by sliding the anchor point in a continuous or discontinuous interval. The minimum is placed on the left, accordingly the maximum value is on the right. Sliders can set icons at the left and right ends of the slider to reflect the strength of the values. This interactive feature makes it an excellent choice when setting options such as volume, brightness, color saturation, etc. that need to reflect the intensity level.
